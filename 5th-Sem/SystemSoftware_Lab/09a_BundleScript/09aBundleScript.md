## Aim
Shell script that accepts file names specified as arguments and creates a shell script that contains this file as well as the code to recreate these files. Thus if the script generated by your script is executed, it would recreate the original files(This is same as the "bundle" script described by Brain W. Kernighan and Rob Pike in "The Unix Programming Environment", Prentice - Hall India).

## Description
<p>$*: Contains all the input arguments</p>

## Code
```
for x in $*
do
	echo "cat>$x<<end
	abc
	def
	end"
done > recreate
```

## Compile
```
./09.sh abc.txt def.txt
```

## Output
```
$ sh 9a.sh abc.txt def.txt
$ sh recreate
```
```
$ cat abc.txt
abc
def
```
```
$ cat def.txt
abc
def
```
